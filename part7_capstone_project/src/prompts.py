        Article Content: {content}

        TASK: Extract specific developer tool/service names mentioned in the content that are relevant to the query.

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - Focus on concrete products, platforms, libraries, or services developers can actually use
        - Include both open-source (e.g., React, PostgreSQL) and commercial (e.g., AWS, Vercel) tools
        - Prioritize tools that directly address the query's intent
        - Limit to maximum 5 most relevant tools
        - Only extract tools that are explicitly named in the content

        OUTPUT FORMAT:
        Return only tool names, one per line, ranked by relevance to the query.
        If no relevant tools are found, return "No relevant tools found."

        EXAMPLES:
        For query "database solutions for startups":
        Supabase
        PlanetScale
        Railway
        Firebase
        MongoDB

        For query "frontend frameworks":
        React
        Vue.js
        Angular
        Svelte
        Next.js"""
